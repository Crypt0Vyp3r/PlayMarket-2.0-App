DAO PlayMarket 2.0 is a decentralized Android App Store that accepts payments in cryptocurrency and is combined with an ICO platform for developers.


Personal freedom is impossible without economic security and independence. Therefore, we created an open, censorship-resistant marketplace using blockchain and smart contracts.

The application supports Android 5.0 and above.
Works on Rinkeby network.


## Features include:

  1. Local ethereum wallet creation.
  2. Buying apps with cryptocurrency.
  3. Offline creating and signing of transactions.
  4. Transfer and exchange ether.



## How it works

The mobile app is developed on the basis of the modern technologies recommended by Android Developers (the so-called native technologies). 

The app is equipped with a cold wallet created directly on the mobile device. The app supports encrypted backup and restore of wallets, secure key storage and offline signing of transactions. This means that your keys are kept on the device and never sent anywhere to make a purchase. 

The app supports the Markdown markup language which provides simple and standard formatting of app descriptions, thereby allowing developers to create beautiful designs for placing apps on the platform. The mobile app has a mechanism for detecting the nearest trusted connection node. Now the app uses DNS, but in the future it will be connected directly to the blockchain to find the nearest node.


All communications between the app and the node are encrypted using the TLS protocol. 

After installation, the app suggests generating a new wallet or importing an existing one. A wallet can be replenished directly or through a cryptocurrency exchange. 

The mobile app connects to the nearest node and receives from it all the necessary information about apps, their price, etc., as well as displays all the data on the screen. 

When you purchase an app, PlayMarket 2.0 generates a transaction, which is transferred to the node. The task of the node is to check the transaction, the balance and, if all conditions are met, to issue the purchased app by sending a transaction to the blockchain. After the mobile app is downloaded, smart contracts indicate the purchase data: name of the app and the node through which the transaction has been made. This is necessary for the subsequent distribution of profits.
